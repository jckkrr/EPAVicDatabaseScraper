This matter arises after Renu Waste was granted a Planning Permit in May 2016 by Mildura Rural City Council to operate a waste receiving and processing facility at the Premises. Several months later~ EPA granted Renu Waste with a Research Development and Demonstration Approval permit (RD&amp;D) for a waste to energy plant to process shredded tyres. One of the key reasons EPA approved the RD&amp;D application was because Renu Waste provided a Risk Management and Emergency Plan to EPA advising that the: ‘Number of whole tyres on site will not exceed 500…and will always  be under the EPA 5~000 threshold maximum number’ After the RD&amp;D permit was issued~ Renu Waste began entering into a range of commercial agreements with local tyre retailers in and around Mildura to collect their waste tyres.  The tyres were then transported to the Premises and stockpiled. In March 2018~ EPA conducted an inspection at the Premises which revealed that approximately 30~000 tyres had been deposited on the site. Consequently~ the EPA issued Renu Waste with a Clean Up Notice (First CUN) to reduce the number of tyres on the Premises to less than 5000 tyres by July 2018.  Subsequently and in April 2018~ Cristal Mining advised Renu Waste it could no longer use the Premises because it failed to meet contractual obligations regarding the use of the Premises but would be provided access for the purposes of complying with the First CUN. EPA conducted a compliance inspection in July 2018 concerning the First CUN and it was observed the size of the tyre stockpiles had increased. In August 2018~ Renu Waste was advised its RD&amp;D permit was revoked. The First CUN was then also revoked and a fresh CUN (Second CUN) was issued in its place requiring Renu Waste to: a) cease accepting industrial waste: and b) to remove all industrial waste (namely tyres) from the Premises by November 2018. The Second CUN was not complied with.</td>\n",

The sentence included an order made under Section 64 of the EP Act requiring the Accused to undertake a clean-up of the premises by 29 November 2019. A compliance inspection of the premises undertaken in December 2019 revealed large amounts of industrial waste remaining on the premises. In August 2020~ proceedings were commenced by way of an application under Section 64 of the EP Act to enforce the Section 64 order. The Accused was given multiple opportunities by the Court to undertake a full clean-up of the premises~ however as of 18 January 2020~ he had failed to do so.   \n",
       "340  This matter concerned a large tyre stockpile (in exceedance of 30~000 tyres) that was accumulated on private land in Mildura~ Victoria (the Premises) by Renu Waste between 2017 and 2018.  The Premises was owned by Cristal Mining Australia Limited (Cristal Mining) but being used by Renu Waste. This matter arises after Renu Waste was granted a Planning Permit in May 2016 by Mildura Rural City Council to operate a waste receiving and processing facility at the Premises. Several months later~ EPA granted Renu Waste with a Research Development and Demonstration Approval permit (RD&D) for a waste to energy plant to process shredded tyres. One of the key reasons EPA approved the RD&D application was because Renu Waste provided a Risk Management and Emergency Plan to EPA advising that the: ‘Number of whole tyres on site will not exceed 500…and will always  be under the EPA 5~000 threshold maximum number’ After the RD&D permit was issued~ Renu Waste began entering into a range of commercial agreements with local tyre retailers in and around Mildura to collect their waste tyres.  The tyres were then transported to the Premises and stockpiled. In March 2018~ EPA conducted an inspection at the Premises which revealed that approximately 30~000 tyres had been deposited on the site. Consequently~ the EPA issued Renu Waste with a Clean Up Notice (First CUN) to reduce the number of tyres on the Premises to less than 5000 tyres by July 2018.  Subsequently and in April 2018~ Cristal Mining advised Renu Waste it could no longer use the Premises because it failed to meet contractual obligations regarding the use of the Premises but would be provided access for the purposes of complying with the First CUN. EPA conducted a compliance inspection in July 2018 concerning the First CUN and it was observed the size of the tyre stockpiles had increased. In August 2018~ Renu Waste was advised its RD&D permit was revoked. The First CUN was then also revoked and a fresh CUN (Second CUN) was issued in its place requiring Renu Waste to: a) cease accepting industrial waste: and b) to remove all industrial waste (namely tyres) from the Premises by November 2018. The Second CUN was not complied with.   \n",

Coliban Water will pay $150~000 towards the rehabilitation project to the ecosystem of Snipes Creek~ which is a tributary of the Campaspe River~ and will also be placed on a two-year bond and pay costs of $10~000 to EPA. In December 2020~ at the Kyneton Magistrates' Court~ Coliban Water pleaded guilty to EPA charges of causing or permitting an environmental hazard and pollution of waters. The Court also recorded convictions on those charges. The Court agreed to adjourn the matter until 2 March 2021 to allow EPA to complete an evaluation process consistent with the Inspiring Environmental Solutions (IES) Guidelines which allows for Court-ordered community projects to be funded. Magistrate Southey found that~ taking prior offences into account~ Coliban Water should contribute to the EPA's proposed program under the Environment Protection Act 1970.   \n",

The release of the sulphuric acid was caused by JOHNSON's failure to properly secure the acid in his tanker. On 30 March 2021~ before Magistrate Capell~ he entered pleas of guilty to the four charges. JOHNSON was convicted and fined $50~000.00~ ordered to pay $94~855.61 in compensation to the Greater Geelong City Council to pay for the clean-up of the sulphuric acid and $3~400.00 in costs to the EPA.   \n",
